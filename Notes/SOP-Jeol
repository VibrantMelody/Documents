Dear sir/madam
I am Jeol Rai, a Nepali student submitting my statement of purpose for a student visa application to study Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT) at Sydney International School of Technology and Commerce, Australia. My academic background along with the reasons for selecting this particular course and future goals post completion of my studies are detailed in this document.

Academic Background & Inclination
I took computer science as an optional subject for 2 years until grade 10th and scored a 4.0 GPA in that particular subject and a 3.75 GPA overall. In those two years, I developed some of the basic understandings of computing, it's the hardware and software but the lack of adequate infrastructures available limited the learning process. Hence, I joined GCE A-levels, an internationally recognized program seeing it as a solution for all that and completed the first year at Ace Institute in Nepal. But no matter the course structure and program the physical lack of infrastructure could not be changed. One great thing about studying in an internationally recognized program meant I could study the same program in a different place, which I did, and for the second year of my A-levels, I went ahead to study in Siliguri India. But because of COVID I had to be back home and for a year I just did self-studying and gave exams. Finally completing the program in march 2021 with a score of Physics C, Mathematics B, Chemistry B & General Paper D. In a sector like Information Technology which I am pursuing, I need to be dynamic, flexible and always acquiring new knowledge to keep me competitive in an always changing work environment, which I dont see happening in Nepal. Hence, I decided to study abroad.

I appeared for the IELTS test on 19th March 2022 and secured an overall score of 7.5/9 (Listening 9.0, Reading 8.0, Writing 6.5 & Speaking 6.5).
